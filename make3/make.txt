how to build/test j32/j64/j64avx/j64avx2 for linux/darwin/raspberry/...

**************************************************************************
# commands are assumed to run in make2 folder

# make sure shell scripts are executable
chmod +x *.sh

# ensure proper jsrc/jversion.h (default jversion-x.h template)

# !!! make2 build commands will be confused if there are *.o files in jsrc
# !!! makefiles do not have h file dependencies !!!
# after h file changes, run ./clean.sh to rm all *.o files for clean build
./clean.sh

# general format for build_... commands 
# don't miss the ./ part when typing commands
jplatform=(..) j64x=(..) ./build_libj.sh

where 
jplatform : linux darwin raspberry  (default host)
j64x : j64 j64avx j64avx2 j32  (default host or j64avx)

# binaries generated inside the bin folder under jsource

# eg. build j64 binaries
jplatform=linux j64x=j64 ./build_libj.sh

# linux and j64 is the default on 64-bit linux, so this is fine
./build_libj.sh

# the easiest way to build all binaries
# this will run ./clean.sh and can detect the host platform
./build_all.sh

# test
# cp jconsole libj.so libtsdll.so to the folder jlibrary/bin
# cd the jlibrary/bin folder and run 
./jconsole ../../test/tsu.ijs

# and follow instructions there
